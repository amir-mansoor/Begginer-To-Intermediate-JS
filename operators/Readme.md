### JavaScript Assignment

The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable:

Example 
```javascript 
let a = 10;
```

```javascript
// Assign the value 10 to a
let a = 10;
// Assign the value 20 to b
let b = 20;
// Assign the value a + b to c:
let c = a + b
```

we can also do multiplication with this operator *

++ is used for increment 
example 
```javascript
let x = 10;
x++;
```

and -- is used for decrement 
```javascript
let y = 20;
y--
```
